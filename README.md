## Description

The purpose of this specific software is to provide a platform to those such gardeners who want to build their dream gardens but do not have enough capital for it, so they can post their incentives using our story posting feature and other users can donate to that gardener if they find the gardener trustworthy and genuine.

- The motivation behind working on this project is to teach myself mobile development using flutter as well as to evolve my ideas into a working application.

## Installation

- You need to have NodeJS LTS version installed on your system.
- You also need MongoDB Locally installed on your system.
- After this when you wish to run the app using emulator you can get the IP address from ipconfig command in terminal then replace the uri constant inside the ./utils/constants.dart file
- However if you are using mobile, first of all connect your mobile internet to your pc then get that IP address and replace the uri constant as discussed above
- Once that is done, go ahead to the ./backend/config folder and replace the MongoDBLocalURI with your MongoDB uri connection string 
- You must have the working flutter development enviornment with an android/ios device or working emulator.
- You can install the dependencies before running the application. (pub get for flutter) and (npm i) for backend folder
- Then you can simply run the flutter run command and select your device.
